# Learn Bundler

---

Simple POC repository for learning playwright-python. The goal is to create an application in python that leverages playwright to screenshot and save a Microsoft Learn module. All units should be bundled and stored in a specific **export** directory, inside a sub-directory identified by the module name.

**NOTE** - Current output format mainly suits mobile devices. That was the initial goal of the project so that a user could review modules on their mobile device whilst preparing for their next exam.
